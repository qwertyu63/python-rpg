# Python-RPG
This is an engine for a text-based RPG written in Python. I made it mostly as a "how to Python" challenge for myself.
I'm sure it has a ton of issues, but it runs. There are more features on the way, but they aren't ready yet.  
The legal version of this is below, but go nuts. If this give you an idea, chase it. If you do, I'd love to know about it.
